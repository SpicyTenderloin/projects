## Tiny Whoops

Tiny whoops take a lot of crash damage for their size, and motors are usually the first thing to go, so replacing one is a routine repair rather than a rare one. Inspecting and reflowing the solder joints under magnification makes the difference between a clean, reliable repair and one that fails again mid-flight.

## Practicing in the simulator

Acro mode has no self-levelling: the sticks command rotation rates directly, and the pilot is fully responsible for attitude, so building that muscle memory in a simulator first is far cheaper than doing it over real hardware. I use a Radiomaster transmitter bound directly to a laptop simulator to practice freestyle and racing lines before flying them for real.

## SpeedyBee 5" Drone

5-inch FPV quadcopter build using a SpeedyBee F405 V4 flight controller stack, working from the board's own pinout reference to wire up the LED, VTX, and receiver connections correctly.
