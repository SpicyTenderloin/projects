**Task:** implement the classic "Simon" memory game from scratch on a microcontroller dev board (QUT's in-house "QUTy" board), driving a 7-segment display and buzzer from four pushbuttons, with the playback speed adjustable via a potentiometer.

**Approach:** wrote bare-metal embedded C firmware structured around clear hardware driver modules: ADC sampling for the potentiometer, button input handling, buzzer tone generation, a timer for game pacing, SPI for driving the 7-segment display, UART for debug output, and a pseudo-random sequence generator for the growing pattern the player has to repeat. Each driver only exposes what the game logic needs (read a button, play a tone, light a segment), so the hardware-facing code stays separate from the game rules. Game logic sat on top as a state machine handling sequence playback, input matching, and scoring, advancing the sequence length each time the player successfully repeats it back and resetting on a wrong input.

**Outcome:** a working implementation of the full game loop: an increasingly long sequence of lights and tones that the player has to reproduce, with the game over and high score logic to match. No photos or video of the running board are on hand for this one yet, that would be a good addition if a build is still around to capture.
