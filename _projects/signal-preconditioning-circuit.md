**Task:** design the analog front-end for a digital voice recorder built around a microcontroller's analog-to-digital converter (ADC). A microphone signal needed to be conditioned, centred, filtered, and amplified so it would make full use of the ADC's input range without clipping or aliasing, while preserving the frequency range that matters most for speech intelligibility.

**Approach:** the design cascades four op-amp stages: a microphone interface stage, a buffer/pre-amplifier, a multi-stage anti-aliasing filter, and a final amplification stage.

Component values for each stage were calculated using custom MATLAB scripts, then verified in LTspice simulation before being built and tested on a breadboard.

A decoupling capacitor was added close to the op-amp's supply pins to deal with noise picked up through the power leads, the comparison below shows just how much cleaner the supply rail is with it in place. Bench measurements (bode plots and live transient captures) were compared back against the simulated predictions at every stage to validate the design.

**Outcome:** the simulated frequency response confirmed the cascaded stages met the passband and attenuation targets needed to avoid aliasing while keeping the speech-critical frequency range intact.

On the bench, measured bode plots closely tracked the simulated response.

A live capture of the circuit's output while speaking into the microphone showed the signal properly centred and using most of the ADC's input range, exactly as designed.
