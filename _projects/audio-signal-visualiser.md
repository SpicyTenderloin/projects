Launched and lead this project with the Electrical Engineering Student Society (EESS) at QUT, giving members hands-on experience with analog circuit design and embedded systems.

Beyond the breadboard prototype, I also designed a PCB for the project's signal pre-conditioning stage, the analog front end that conditions an incoming audio signal before it reaches the display.

## Writing a tool to design the filter stage

Picking real resistor and capacitor values for a multi-stage active filter is normally a tedious, manual process: you work out the ideal pole locations and Q factor for each stage, then hunt through standard component value tables trying to get close to them while keeping the op-amp gain stable. I wrote a Python tool to automate that search. Given a passband and stopband specification, it generates a Chebyshev or Butterworth prototype filter, splits it into cascaded Sallen-Key biquad stages, then brute-force searches real E12/E24 resistor and capacitor values for each stage, scoring every candidate combination on how closely it reproduces the target frequency and Q factor while respecting the amplifier's gain stability limit. The result is an automatically generated bill of materials for a filter that's actually buildable with off-the-shelf parts, rather than the idealised component values a textbook design gives you.

**Outcome:** a working command-line tool that takes a filter specification and outputs a buildable component list, a Bode plot comparing the ideal and realised response, and a saved JSON record of the design. It's reusable for any future Sallen-Key filter stage I need to design, rather than being a one-off calculation done by hand each time.
