**Task:** as part of a small team, design a super-heterodyne RF receiver covering 3 to 5 GHz against a client-style specification: defined channel bandwidth, image and spurious signal rejection, sensitivity, and signal-to-noise ratio.

**Approach:** the design uses a two-stage down-conversion architecture, mixing the incoming signal down to an intermediate frequency in two steps to balance image rejection against selectivity. I focused on the conceptual design and the MATLAB-based verification work, modelling the mixer's output spectrum to check that unwanted spurious products stayed clear of the intermediate frequency across the full tuning range, and confirming the design against the link budget (sensitivity, dynamic range, and SNR) using hand calculations cross-checked in MATLAB.

**Outcome:** the verified design met every target in the specification: a minimum discernible signal of -98 dBm, output SNR well above the 3 dB demodulator requirement across the full input power range, and a dynamic range of close to 40 dB. The spurious-response analysis below confirms the unwanted mixer products stay clear of the intermediate frequency at both ends of the local oscillator's tuning range.
