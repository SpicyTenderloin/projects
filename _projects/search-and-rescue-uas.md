**Task:** as part of a nine-person team over two semesters, develop an unmanned aerial system capable of autonomously searching for a missing person, recognising them, and delivering aid, without a pilot in the loop once the mission started.

**Approach:** I worked within the Autopilot and Navigation subsystem. A Pixhawk flight controller handled low-level flight control, talking to a Raspberry Pi companion computer over MAVLink, while the Pi ran ROS, a custom-trained YOLOv5 model over an OAK-D RGB-D camera feed for real-time object detection, and the mission logic tying it all together. The aircraft flew a planned search pattern from takeoff to landing entirely autonomously, avoiding obstacles marked in an occupancy grid. On a positive detection of the target mannequin, it would divert from its search pattern to deliver an EpiPen, streaming mission data back to a ground control station throughout. I came into the project with limited prior experience in ROS and Linux, and leaned on a systems engineering approach, breaking the navigation subsystem's requirements down into concrete, testable deliverables (calibrating the Pixhawk, verifying the Pi-to-flight-controller link, then building up to full autonomous flight) to get up to speed and contribute effectively alongside teammates who'd worked in this stack before.

## Planning the search pattern

One specific piece I built was the coverage path planner: a Python tool that generates a lawnmower-style search pattern covering a defined flight area, based on the camera's field of view and a target overlap percentage between passes, so the whole search area gets photographed with no gaps. It works out row spacing from the camera footprint at the planned altitude, alternates sweep direction each row, and stitches in safe takeoff, staging, and return waypoints around the actual search pattern.

**Outcome:** a working autonomous search-and-rescue demonstration: takeoff, a fully autonomous obstacle-avoiding search pattern, real-time onboard object detection, and an autonomous diversion to the target, all without manual piloting.

The detection and planning side of this can be seen running live: the target detected and an occupancy grid path planned around obstacles in RViz, alongside the tmux session SSH'd into the onboard Pi showing the underlying ROS logs.

The result came down to dedicated teamwork and structured planning across a large team more than any one person's individual contribution, which is the main thing I took from the project.
